description: Getting started with Two Mi18n.
---

Two Mi18n is a client-side oriented library. It is designed to be included via a script tag. It is also available as a npm package.

## Installation via script tag

```html
<html>
	<head>
		...
		<script
			defer
			src="https://unpkg.com/two-mi18n@latest/dist/TwoMi18n.umd.js"
		></script>
	</head>
	...
</html>
```

> The `defer` attribute in the script tag. It is important to use it to make sure the script is loaded before the page is rendered.

Note the `latest` tag in the URL. You can also use a specific version number. Here is the [list of available versions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/two-mi18n?activeTab=versions).
See [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) for more details.

```html
<script
	defer
	src="https://unpkg.com/two-mi18n@1.0/dist/TwoMi18n.umd.js"
></script>
```

## Installation via npm as a module

You can also install Two Mi18n as an npm module.

> Note that you will only be able to use the function [`translate()`](usages/translate) with this method. The function [`translateHTML()`](usages/translate-html) is only available when using the script tag.

```bash frame="none"
npm i two-mi18n
```

Now you can use it in your code.

```js
import TwoMi18n from "two-mi18n";

const twoMi18n = new TwoMi18n({
	default: "en",
	translations: {
		en: {
			"Hello world": "Hello world",
		},
		fr: {
			"Hello world": "Bonjour le monde",
		},
	},
});

console.log(twoMi18n.translate("Hello world", "fr")); // Bonjour le monde
```

> See [`TwoMi18n`](usages/initialization#the-twomi18n-object) class, [`translation object`](usages/initialization#the-translations-object), and [`translate()`](usages/translate).
