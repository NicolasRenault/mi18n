To help while developing, `Two-Mi18n` throws errors when something is wrong.
They are all prefixed with the text `[Two-Mi18n]`.

## Validation of the [`translation object`](/usages/initialization#the-translations-object).

Too help validating the [`translation object`](/usages/initialization#the-translations-object), some errors are thrown in the constructor of [`TwoMi18n`](/usages/initialization#the-twomi18n-object).

### The translations object is not defined.

This error is thrown when the [`translation object`](/usages/initialization#the-translations-object) is not defined.

```js
const twoMi18n = new TwoMi18n();
// Error: [Two-Mi18n] Something is wrong with the translation object:
//          The translations object is not defined.
```

### The 'default' property is not defined.

This error is thrown when the `default` property is not defined in the [`translation object`](/usages/initialization#the-translations-object).
The `default` property is required.

Example:

```js
const translations = {
	en: {
		hello: "Hello",
	},
	fr: {
		hello: "Bonjour",
	},
};

const twoMi18n = new TwoMi18n(translations);
// Error: [Two-Mi18n] Something is wrong with the translation object:
//          The 'default' property is not defined.
```

### The default language "x" is not defined in the translations object.

This error is thrown when the default language is not defined in the [`translation object`](/usages/initialization#the-translations-object).

```js
const translations = {
	default: "en",
	fr: {
		hello: "Bonjour",
	},
};

const twoMi18n = new TwoMi18n(translations);
// Error: [Two-Mi18n] Something is wrong with the translation object:
//          The default language "en" is not defined in the translations object.
```

{/* TODO finish errors from _getTranslationsLang */}
