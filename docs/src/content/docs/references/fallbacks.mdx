title: Fallbacks
---

I have designed Two Mi18n to be as easy to use as possible. That's why I have added some fallbacks to make sure you don't have to worry about some tricky cases.

## Key fallbacks

If the key for the translation is not found in the `translation object`, it will return the key itself with the tag `[TwoMi18n]` in front, so you can easlisy search in the page to find any missed keys.

```js
twoMi18n.translate("title.color", "fr"); // [TwoMi18n]title.color
```

## Languages fallbacks

For both methods, you need to pass the language you want to translate to.

```js
twoMi18n.translate("hello", "fr"); // Bonjour
```

**If you pass a language that is not in the [`translation object`](/usages/initialization#the-translations-object), it will try the first 2 letters.**
This behavior is useful if you want to specify language variations depending on the location.
For example `en-GB`.

```js {13, 14}
const translations = {
	default: "en",
	en: {
		hello: "Hello",
		color: "Color",
	},
	en-GB: {
		hello: "Hello",
		color: "Colour",
	},
};

twoMi18n.translate("color", "en"); // Color
twoMi18n.translate("colour", "en-GB"); // Colour
```

Now if you want to get a translation for a country not defined in the `translation object`, like `en-US`. It will try to match the two first letters.

```js
twoMi18n.translate("Color", "en-US"); // Color
//Fallback to the first two letters. Here "en".
```

If a not-defined variable that doesn't fall back with its two first letters is passed in the param, it will take the value from the `default`.

```js
twoMi18n.translate("color", "it"); // Color
```
