Like most i18n libraries, Two Mi18n needs an object that defines the translations. This object here is strongly opinionated and has some rules that must be followed to be working.

## The translations object

The `translation object` is a simple Javascript object that contains the translations. Its keys are the language keys and its values are objects that contain the translations with keys and values.

**The `translation object` must have a `default` key that contains the default language.**
It is the fallback for any case where the language is not valid.

```js
const translations = {
	default: "en",
	en: {
		hello: "Hello",
		world: "World",
	},
	fr: {
		hello: "Bonjour",
		world: "Monde",
	},
};
```

**The default language value must exist in the `translation object`**

## The TwoMi18n object

The `TwoMi18n` object is the main and only object of the library. It contains the two methods of the library, [`translate()`](usages/translate) and [`translateHTML()`](usages/translate-html).

**The translation object will be validated by the `TwoMi18n` constructor. If the `translation object` is not valid, an error will be thrown.**

```js
const twoMi18n = new TwoMi18n(translations);
```
